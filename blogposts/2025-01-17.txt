Happy New Year!
2025/01/17
Happy New Year! I haven't written in a while; I actually went to Europe over the holidays to spend time with my girlfriend and her family. As this isn't really a personal blog, I won't be writing about that here, but I just wanted to make a super quick post to say that I hope you're all doing great.

Good luck with your resolutions!
