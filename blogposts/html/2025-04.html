<h4>April 28, 2025</h4>
<p>I guess it's been a couple months since I last made a post, but I wanted to share what I've been excited about working on recently.</p>
<p>One thing I've always been very interested in was computer graphics. It's always seemed like such a magical thing, to be able to instruct the GPU to draw three-dimensional images on the screen. It's something I've always wanted to play around with; I just never knew where to start.</p>
<p>Well, here we are.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/drawing_terrain.gif" alt="A gif of a rotating 3D model. The model resembles basic terrain without any texturing." /></p>
<p>This model was generated entirely from code, using <a href="https://github.com/15rtrujillo/Dungeon/blob/f5baa0897f13aa765fdf2ef479a9a56a30cb6d30/Content/height.txt">this data file</a> as a heightmap. I will admit that I did have some help, as I used the MonoGame framework to handle most of the direct OpenGL calls. You can see the drawing code for yourself <a href="https://github.com/15rtrujillo/Dungeon/blob/fe0f04302a91f945610bf5c34ee873555fd04c79/TerrainRenderer.cs">here</a>.</p>
<p>Side note: If you aren't familiar with MonoGame, from what I understand it's essentially an open-source, multi-platform wrapper for Microsoft's old XNA game development framework.</p>
<p>I know that for people familiar with 3D graphics that this probably doesn't seem too impressive, but this is pretty new to me and I'm still learning.</p>
<p>To further my learning, I eventually would like to delve even deeper into the layers of abstraction and work directly with something like OpenGL or DirectX. I recently acquired a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Rendering-Fourth-Tomas-Akenine-M%C3%B6ller/dp/1138627003">Real Time Rendering, Fourth Edition</a> by Tomas Akenine-Moller, Eric Haines, and Naty Hoffman (that's not an affiliate link). I've only had the chance to read through the first chapter so far, but I find all of it so interesting.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's all I have for now. I hope you're having a good time with all of your learning endeavors!
