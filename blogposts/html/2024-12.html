<h4>December 10, 2024</h4>
<p>Yesterday, I watched a movie with my girlfriend that I'm not even sure I can properly pronounce the name of, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the experience.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to mention that I'm not typically one to watch these kinds of "artistic" movies. The closest thing I've ever watched is probably <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, and really, that's nothing like this movie. It would be an understatement to say that my girlfriend has introduced me to movies that I never would have watched on my own, but of course I consider that a good thing.</p>
<p>If you've never seen the movie for yourself, the best way I can describe the movie is by saying that it's a documentary, but those who have seen it will know that's not quite accurate. For one thing, the movie has no spoken dialogue at all. The entire movie consists of video clips and musical pieces (which are excellent, I might point out). The only time the movie speaks directly towards the audience is at the end, but I'll touch more on that later on.</p>
<p>The clips that are included in the movie vary in their subject matter. At the beginning of the movie, most of the clips portray nature scenes that, as someone from Utah, were actually pretty familiar to me--a lot of red rocks and canyons. As the movie progresses, we start to see more and more of humanity creep onto the scene. We see huge parking lots full of cars packed tightly together, which is then followed by a huge parking lot of tanks packed tightly together. To be honest, I have no idea where they would get a shot like that; it's crazy to imagine that there are (or were) that many tanks in the same location.</p>
<p>The majority of the clips, however, come from busy cities and the workplaces of the people that live in the cities. There are so many scenes of traffic, people navigating the subways, and people crowding around in malls. Some of my favorite sections consisted of footage of assembly lines, where they would show time-lapsed footage of factory workers carrying out their day-to-day. This might sound kind of silly, but I also really enjoyed a couple scenes in which the movie had time-lapsed footage of people in an arcade. It's quite something to watch people playing entire levels of Pac-Man in a couple seconds!</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm tipping my hand a bit early here, but the whole time I was expecting the movie to turn sour or critical towards the humanity on display. I was expecting all this hustle-and-bustle to be juxtaposed with starving children, shots of war and violence, or at least natural disasters. However, it didn't really come. As far as I can remember, the rows and rows of tanks at the beginning were the only hint at war, and at that point it felt more like a spectacle than a commentary, especially because of the music.</p>
<p>Speaking of the music, I enjoyed it quite a lot. Philip Glass did the score for this movie and while it was different, it was quite nice to listen to. Now, I haven't confirmed this, but I swear that throughout the hour-and-twenty-minute runtime, there were only about three pieces of music. The one piece that plays over the footage of city life seems to go on for at least 40 minutes. I was seriously impressed with how long some of the tracks felt, and yet they never really got tiring. I'm not super knowledgeable when it comes to music, but I noticed that some of the pieces also had interesting elements to them, like time signatures that you don't hear too often. I could definitely listen to this soundtrack in the future, detached from the film.</p>
<p>Getting back to the film, I do want to comment on the ending. Above, I mentioned a lot of the scenes that I enjoyed during the city-life portion of the movie, but for the most part these scenes were just enjoyable to watch. To me at least, nothing seemed to really have anything to say other than "humans are busy creatures and we make a lot of stuff." However, one of the last scenes of the movie is (what I believe to be) the launching and subsequent explosion of the Challenger rocket. While an impacting scene on its own, the thing that ended up getting to me was just how long the shot <em>lingered</em>. I am not exaggerating when I say that for about five minutes the shot tracks one of the rocket engines as it plummets back to Earth, on fire and spinning wildly.</p>
<p>While watching this, I had a few thoughts occur to me, and I will be honest and say that I even got a bit emotional. As a race, we humans have been able to do some pretty extraordinary things. We've been able to build massive cities with staggering infrastructure, we've been able to dive deep into the sea (though not all the way to the bottom in some parts), and we've been able to reach up into space and touch the moon. Even after all this, however, we are still faced with plenty of humbling setbacks. The worst part is that those setbacks are usually caused by us. The Challenger rocket explosion was the result of a few small mistakes culminating in a tragedy. How many other times have we halted our progression or set ourselves back because of mistakes and errors in judgement? Both as humanity and individuals.</p>
<p>Not content to leave us with just images, the movie finally speaks to us. We are given two slides of text. The first one gives us definitions of the word "koyaanisqatsi." Apparently, this is a Hopi word meaning:</p>
<blockquote>"crazy life," "life in turmoil," "life out of balance," "life disintegrating," "a state of life that calls for another way of living."</blockquote>
<p>The second slide translates the chanting that was heard during the duration of the final music track of the movie. It turns out the chanting was three Hopi prophecies:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster."</li>
<li>"Near the Day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth in the sky."</li>
<li>"A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans."</li>
</ul>
<p>
These lines of text serve to recontextualize the whole movie. It seems that the movie was going to end up at the "humans can be bad" position, it just took the entire movie to get there. Of course, there's more to it than that, and perhaps the film could've been more critical throughout if that was the point it wanted to make, but from what I understand, it was pretty revolutionary at the time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm glad that my girlfriend suggested that we watch this movie. Apparently, there is a sequel, and I look forward to watching that, too.

<h4>December 4, 2024</h4>
<p>My first exposure to programming occurred around age 10 when my father introduced me to the Phrogram programming language. I'm not sure if it exists anymore, but it was a programming language and enviornment that was designed to help beginners (especially children) get into programming, specifically games programming. I will be honest and say that I didn't really accomplish much with this program.</p>
<p>I could go off on a side tangent here about "Club Spider," but this probably isn't the best place. Perhaps I'll write about it in another post one day.</p>
<p>I didn't really try programming again until I was 14. I don't remember what got me interested in the subject again, but I remember asking my dad how I could learn to program. He was currently working with C# in his job, and so he gave me a C# book that he had used himself years ago. The book was <em>Sams Teach Yourself C# in 24 Hours</em> by James Foxall. He highlighted some chapters I should read (which was most of them), helped me install Visual Studio on my laptop, and left me to work.</p>
<p>To say I fell in love with programming would be an understatement. I went through all the chapters my dad had suggested in no time at all, following along with every code example. Sometimes I would even take the book with me to read when I would leave the house. It wasn't very long before I outgrew the examples and lessons in the book and wanted to try my own thing.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, my first personal project was a game. Yes, I tried to write a game with C# using WinForms. Of course it was awful, and I never ended up finishing it, but I did learn a lot. I could actually write a whole other blog post about that game and the ones that I tried to make after that, but again, that's probably for another day.</p>
<p>There were other personal projects after that, but what probably helped my programming the most was when I got into Roblox. Roblox is an online platform where users can create their own games and share them with others. Honestly, while the platform gets a bad rep, I still think it's one of the easiest ways for people to get into game programming. A lot of the tedious parts (3D art in particular) are handled by the engine, since the idea with Roblox is that it's "digital Lego." Since you don't have to waste your time 3D modeling, you can spend more time learning how to program.</p>
<p>Roblox uses Lua as its scripting language. It was a pretty rough transition from C# to Lua, and it took a lot of tinkering before I felt comfortable with the language. However, after lots of practice and studying other people's scripts, I was able to pick up a decent amount of knowledge. I still remember writing my first script all on my own (all it did was change the color of a brick when you touched it), and the feeling of accomplishment that came along with it. I never made any insanely successful games, but I did make a couple that got a decent amount of players over the years.</p>
<p>Once I got comfrotable enough with Lua, I decided that I wanted to share what I had learned with others. I started making Roblox Lua scripting tutorials on YouTube. I'm not going to link my channel at this time, because I don't really feel comfortable linking my YouTube with my real name, but you could probably find it if you looked hard enough. I spent most of my high school and college years making scripting tutorials for YouTube; some weeks I would even manage to upload daily videos. Making and sharing these videos is one of the things that helped me decide I wanted to become a teacher.</p>
<p>Speaking of college, that's where my programming journey took me next. WHile my original major was Psychology, I switched to programming after my freshman year. I won't go into why I decided to switch in this post, but I loved it.</p>
<p>I won't go into everything I learned in college, but I will mention our final project. The final project for my degree came in two phases. The first phase was to write a virtual machine and an assembler to run on the virtual machine. Ever since my Computer Architecture class, I had been facinated with assembly, so this project was very exciting for me. We would write assembly programs to test our assembler and virtual machines, and sometimes it was difficult to find where the bugs were since there were those three layers of failure points.</p>
<p>The second phase was to write a complier. Essentially, we were given the grammer for a C-style language that we had to lex, parse, and generate assembly instructions to run on our virutal machines. Again, this project was a ton of fun for me. While I will admit that I found the project to be quite difficult, I did manage to finish it and when I did, that was one of the best feelings I'd ever felt.</p>
<p>These days, I teach computer classes at a high school, including programming, computer science, and game development. I still work on personal projects as often as I can, and I'm always trying to learn new things. Programming is just one of those things that has always been a part of my life, and I know that it will continue to be there for the rest of it, too.</p>
<p>That's pretty much my personal history with programming. I might've left out some things here and there; I would probably get tired of writing if I went into every detail and project. You can check out the <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> if you want to see some of the projects I've worked on. As I mentioned, this won't include anything from my YouTube channel or my Roblox account (at least not right now), but it will include a lot of other things that I've worked on over the years.

<h2 id="2024/12/03">Welcome to My Site!</h2>
<h4>December 3, 2024</h4>
<p>I recently decided that I wanted make a website.</p>
<p>I spent a long time deciding what type of website this should be, however I think I have finally settled on making this a blog. I've always wanted to be better at journaling and getting my thoughts down somewhere, so this might be a nice way to do that.</p>
<p>I don't know how often I'll be updating this, but I would like to try to write something at least a couple times a month.</p>
<p>As far as topics go, you can expect anything. I will say that my interests usually revolve around gaming and programming, so you can probably expect most of my posts to be about those topics. Sometimes I might write reviews of games I've been playing, other times I might write about different game mechanics I've been thinking about recently. Perhaps I might even write about some thoughts I have around online games (specifically MMOs).</p>
<p>Along with the blog, I would also like to create a second page to house a portfolio. I think that this will mostly consist of my programming projects, but perhaps I'll also post some art or writings if I ever get decent at either of those things. Ideally I'd also link my YouTube channel, but I don't really want to tie that to my real-life name. I honestly don't think it would be too hard to figure out, though.</p>
<p>You might be wondering: <em>Why would you have a portfolio section for programming projects when you also link to your Github?</em> That's a good question! I was mostly thinking that it would be nice to have everything in one place. Plus, not all of my programming projects can go on Github for one reason or another, and so it would be nice to have a place to talk about them.</p>
<p>Anyways, that's going to be it for my first post. Hopefully there will be more in the future!
