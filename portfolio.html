                <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
                <p>As outlined in <a href="index.html#2024/12/03">this</a> blog post, the purpose of this page is to serve as a portfolio of my work. Most of my work consists of programming projects, but I am willing to post other works/projects if I feel like they belong here.</p>
                <p>You can read <a href="index.html#2024/12/04">this</a> blog post if you'd like to know my history with programming.</p>

                <h2 id="openrsc">OpenRSC</h2>
                <p>OpenRSC is an open-source project that aims to reproduce and preserve RuneScape Classic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Jagex. The game was shut down in August 2018.</p>
                <p>In the months leading up to its decomission, several players set out to preserve as much information about the game as possible. This was mostly done by using an open-source, third-party client known as RSC+, which had the ability to capture the packet data being sent from and recieved by the client.</p>
                <p>Using these packet captures, the decompiled Java client, and any other information that was recorded about the game, OpenRSC boasts a 98% accurate reporduction of the original game. While this "98%" number might not be wholly accurate, OpenRSC is the most accurate representation of the game as it was before its shutdown in 2018.</p>
                <p>I joined the OpenRSC project in early 2020, before the COVID lockdowns. I joined mostly because I was interested in learning about online games and how they worked. At the time, I was only in my second year of my computer science degree and didn't really know how client-server multiplayer games worked. This project has taught me a lot, not only about client-server applications and games, but also about working on projects with a team of people.</p>
                <p>Over the years I have contributed a lot to OpenRSC (as you can see on my Github page). Mostly I've done bugfixes, authenticity corrections, and content for the custom "Cabbage" server. I have also done a few larger, engine-focused projects as well.</p>
                <p>OpenRSC mostly consists of three "modules." There's the server (the game engine), "plugins" (the game content, like quests and object/NPC interactions), and the client (which can be built for PC or Android). All of these modules are written in Java, and I have contributed to all of them multiple times during my time with the project.</p>
                <p>The following sections will consist of some of my more-notable contributions to the project.</p>
