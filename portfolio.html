                <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
                <p>As outlined in <a href="index.html#2024/12/03">this</a> blog post, the purpose of this page is to serve as a portfolio of my work. Most of my work consists of programming projects, but I am willing to post other works/projects if I feel like they belong here.</p>
                <p>You can read <a href="index.html#2024/12/04">this</a> blog post if you'd like to know my history with programming.</p>

                <h2 id="openrsc">OpenRSC</h2>
                <p><a href="https://rsc.vet">OpenRSC</a> is an open-source project that aims to reproduce and preserve RuneScape Classic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Jagex. The game was shut down in August 2018.</p>
                <p>In the months leading up to its decomission, several players set out to preserve as much information about the game as possible. This was mostly done by using an open-source, third-party client known as RSC+, which had the ability to capture the packet data being sent from and recieved by the client.</p>
                <p>Using these packet captures, the decompiled Java client, and any other information that was recorded about the game, OpenRSC boasts a 98% accurate reporduction of the original game. While this "98%" number might not be wholly accurate, OpenRSC is the most accurate representation of the game as it was before its shutdown in 2018.</p>
                <p>I joined the OpenRSC project in early 2020, before the COVID lockdowns. I joined mostly because I was interested in learning about online games and how they worked. At the time, I was only in my second year of my computer science degree and didn't really know how client-server multiplayer games worked. This project has taught me a lot, not only about client-server applications and games, but also about working on projects with a team of people.</p>
                <p>Over the years I have contributed a lot to OpenRSC (as you can see on my Github page). Mostly I've done bugfixes, authenticity corrections, and content for the custom "Cabbage" server; however, I have also done a few larger, engine-focused projects as well.</p>
                <p>Recently, most of my development efforts have gone towards RSC Cabbage. As mentioned previously, Cabbage is a custom extension of the original RuneScape Classic game, where the aim is to create content that would likely have come to the game were it not discontinued. Specifically, a lot of my efforts go into quality-of-life improvements, quests, and holiday events. Holiday events are a tradition in RuneScape Classic, and usually consist of a miniquest themed around holidays like Easter, Halloween, and Christmas. When it comes to the writing and design, I usually colaborate with one of the other administrators of the project, Aurora.</p>
                <p>The following sections will consist of some of my more-notable contributions to the project. For the benefit of the reader, I will point out that the OpenRSC codebase mainly consists of three "modules," all written in Java. The first module is the game client, which can be built for desktop PCs or as an Android application. The game server is made up of two modules: the server engine itself and "plugins." Plugins contain the code related to content, such as quests or object/NPC interactions.</p>
